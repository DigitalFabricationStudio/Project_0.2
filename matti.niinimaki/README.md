# TITLE OF THE PROJECT

Personal project developed during the Digital Fabrication Studio course, 0.2 edition

Both of these proposals include electronics, but that really shouldn't be an issue as the electronics part of both projects are already working. The part that is missing is the design of the housing.

## PROPOSAL 01 - Chameleon Lamp

Chameleon Lamp is a lamp that changes its color based on the color of the surface it's placed on. A color sensor on the bottom of the lamp detects the color of the surface and controls an RGB light inside the lamp.

### Materials

#### Base of the lamp
<ul>
	<li>Laser cut MDF or plywood</li>
</ul>

#### The Lamp Shade
<ul>
<li>Diffused acrylic</li>
</ul>

#### Electronics
<ul>
<li>BlinkM MaxM</li>
<li>HDJD-S822 Color Sensor Breakout</li>
</ul>
