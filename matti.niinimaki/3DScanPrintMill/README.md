# 3D Scan

I tried to use the kinect to do a 3D Scan. The software I used was cocoaKinect <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8262"/>http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8262</a>

It saves straight to a .stl file, but only from one angle. I tried taking the snapshot from 4 sides, but combining the 4 different objects didn't really work out. Therefore, I just printed one side of the model.

## 3D Print

The final print was done in a very small size to reduce the time, so it's not very detailed.

## Milling, Molding and Casting
The milling turned out better:
