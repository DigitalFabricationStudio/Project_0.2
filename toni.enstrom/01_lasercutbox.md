# Laser cut box

Just an exercise to create a box by laser cutting the pieces with a notches that fit together.

I used online tool (RahulBotics Boxmaker http://boxmaker.rahulbotics.com/) to calculate the blueprint for the box. 


### Learning outcome
Main thing i learnt here was about how to make the pieces fit together tightly enough, and which settings affect that. Basically, i felt there's so many variables (kerf-value, laser speed and power, material type and thickness) that you better make test pieces every time you're about to cut something which needs to be assembled. 

### Settings
My finished box was cut from 3mm MDF, 0.17mm kerf, laser speed 20%, power 60%, 500hz. With these settings the notches were almost too tight to assemble but not quite. 

Same settings with kerf 0.3mm created pieces that dont fit together, and kerf 0.05mm created way too loose connections to pieces hold.
