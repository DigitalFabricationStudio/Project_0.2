A Theo Jansen style walker/strandbeest made with a laser cutter.
<br/><br/>
Jansen's walker thingies look complex, but functional copies of them have already been made from lego bricks too.<br/>
Video example: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpEJ-Ij0yns">youtube</a><br/>
Building instructions (for lego model): <a href="http://www.aupress.ca/books/120175/ebook/05_Dawson_et_al_2010-From_Bricks_To_Brains.pdf">pdf-file</a><br/>
Page 24 has a picture of how the proportions of a leg should be.
<br/><br/>
I'm not sure, but think a similar walkable strandbeest could be made with laser printer, by cutting carefully measured parts out of wood or plastic. This can be complex project, though.

##2 Weatherproof case for my android phone, attachable to bicycle handlebars <br/>
This would probably be a laser cutter project as well. Some kind of a transparent see-through hard plastic case for a mobile device that can be attached to bicycle handlebar. Usage would be so, that the biker could easily use the phone as a camera, navigator/speed meter, clock, etc. while biking, plus the case would also protect the device from rain.

##3. Zoetrope<br/>
Planning to make a zoetrope with a 3d printed bicycling/walking character. I already have animated character in 3d software, from which i can export the "frames" of the movement cycle.
The case for the zoetrope would be most likely laser cut from MDF. Here's first blueprint design for that, but i already noticed that the frames should be odd numbered, not even like here. I'll make better sketch later.
