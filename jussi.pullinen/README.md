# NAME
# LAMP FRAME

Personal project developed during the Digital Fabrication Studio course, 0.2 edition

## PROPOSAL 01
My idea is to make a frame for a lamp. To frame you can attach filters with different colours and shapes that can be projected to walls etc. 

I was thinking a light bulb or led flashlight for the source of light. I will test both options. 

## PROPOSAL 02
This is a proposal for a personal project ...
