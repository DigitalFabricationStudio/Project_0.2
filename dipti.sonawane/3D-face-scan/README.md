## 3D face scan

I took pictures of pour face from all angles including the top and uploaded around 50 pictures to get a 3D scan of my face. An online open source tool was used for this purpose. <a href="http://www.123dapp.com/">www.123dapp.com</a> I tried uploading the pictures twice to see if there was any difference in the quality of the render produced by the software. I uploaded 90 pictures and then 50 pictures the second time round. The result was slightly better the second the time. However, the final image produced was not so good.

The .stl file is placed in the folder. I tried printing in both the 3D printers available, the makerbot and the other 3D printer. The makerbot definitely gave better and finer details in the final output.
