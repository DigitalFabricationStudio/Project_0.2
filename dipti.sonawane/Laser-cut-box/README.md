## Laser cut snap-fit box

I created a box on illustrator. I made the diagram from scratch without using any reference. In the beginning I did a wrong diagram and accidentally landed up making some puzzel pieces which could snap into each other. This happened also because I wanted to test my box in a small size to test the kerf values and then proceed to making the large box.

## Sizes for the box
* Height - 10cm
* width - 10cm
* Depth - 5cm

* MDF thickness - 3mm
* knotch length - 10mm
* kerf value - 0.2mm
