# Modular CityScape

Personal project developed during the Digital Fabrication Studio course, 0.2 edition

## PROPOSAL 01
### Concept
I plan to make a laser cut cityscape set, built out of modular structures, which could be assembled together to build custom playful cityscapes.

Through this project I hope to explore ideas of an imaginary/illustrative city. The forms draw upon the idea of a city, but don’t represent any particular city. The project aims to explore different kinds of joineries in laser cutting. Other small decorative elements within the landscape could be made using the 3D printing. For example: cars, shrubs, lampposts etc. 

The other part of the project is to embed basic electronics using surface mount LEDs and conductive ink. I plan to keep the electronics very minimalistic and it will be as basic as turning on/off of LEDs. These LEDs will be placed inside the buildings. Therefore the buildings should be modular and not be glued (making it easy to replace and modify electronic components inside the buildings).

Here are a few samples of my very early tests of the structures. I created these in the lab so that I can confirm my ideas and plan future sketches. The only part I focused on here was the joinery. The final structures would be more illustrative than these. On Tuesday, I plan to experiment with basic battery-powered electronic circuits and tiny LEDs to test the second half of my project.

### Materials
Initial test was made on a 3mm MDF. I might also try using translucent or transparent acrylic sheets. The translucency of the acrylic sheet would allow the LED lighting to show through the buildings and might provide a better effect of the city being lit. Another idea would be to etch some parts of the acrylic sheets which gives a frosty texture that might give a different look when the LEDs are lit.

### Proposed Size 
Size of the cityscape: 14”x14”
Sizes of buildings and other elements would vary.
