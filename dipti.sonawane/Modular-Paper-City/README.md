## Modular Paper City

This was the final project for the course. I constructed a modular paper city out of lasercut paper that was snapped together to create 3D representations of houses, trees and a bridge. The city was then situated onto a piece of black acrylic, and a basic LED circuit was constructed on it using copper-tape. The blinking of the LEDs were controlled using a potentiometer via an Arduino, and were wired using a technique called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlieplexing">Charlieplexing</a>. I also experimented using surface-mount LEDs for the circuit, and used <a href="http://www.bareconductive.com/">Bare conductive paint</a> to connect them to the copper-tape circuit. Unfortunately, they were too fiddly and time-consuming to mount, and I finally used regular LEDs for the rest of the circuit.

Details of the project, and its documentation are in the accompanying .pdf file.
