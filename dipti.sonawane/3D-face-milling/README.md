## 3D face milling and mould-making

Using the same service from <a href="http://www.123dapp.com/">www.123dapp.com</a>, and Blender, I made a mould in 3D by cutting the generated mesh in half and then building a hollow box around it. The resulting file was then milled using the milling machine to make a foam positive mould. Into this positive mould, I poured food-grade silicone to make the subtractive mould. The silicone was left for 24hrs. to cure. Next day, the silicone mould was ready, and I froze water in it to create ice in the shape of my head.
