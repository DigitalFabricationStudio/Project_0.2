I aim to make a custom pair of moulded shoes made out of plastic, inspired by these cool shoes I saw designed by United Nude.

The idea is that the shoes would be comfortable, because it is made to fit the soles of my feet smoothly.  Especially important that it is comfortable is because high heels usually are the most uncomfortable things in the world besides wedgies.  My aim is to make a nice looking and hopefully ergonomically good shoes that will also look nice.

I started by looking for ways to scan my feet into 3d.  I tried using pictures and 123d catch but the result was not good as I could not keep my feet still in that position, it was a real mess.

I heard a fellow student used kinect to scan his face, so I downloaded the same program OSX connect from (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8262)

I set the kinect on the table, and because the distance was too close, I sat on the next table.  Then I bought the laptop to where I was sitting and arranged myself and the depth settings on the program so I could get a shot of just my leg.  Anyway, I wanted the curvature in my sole when I tiptoe, so I took some shots like that.  But that wasnt getting the bottom of the foot, so I took some like that also.

Because the kinect detects depth pretty nicely, I ended up using the bottom sole shots for the model I will base my shoes on:
