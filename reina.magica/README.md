# NAME
# TITLE OF THE PROJECT

Personal project developed during the Digital Fabrication Studio course, 0.2 edition

## PROPOSAL 01
A customized fitting pair of high-heeled 3d printed sandals.  I will take a 3d scan of my foot and build the footbed of the shoe based on that, and will design the heels etc to withstand my weight.  I plan to use ABS plastic because it is harder.
Actually, I might have issues making the piece that holds the toes on, unless the support pillars are enough to hold it there, I'm thinking about how to solve that.  Maybe I save this project for when I have more time because such a big object would also take more than a few hours to print so class time maybe is not enough.




## PROPOSAL 02
Wall Clock with Laser cut Numbers and Hands
I will get a clock mechanism from a craft shop.
I will add custom made hands and numbers for the clock.
