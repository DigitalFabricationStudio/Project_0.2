# NAME
# TITLE OF THE PROJECT

Personal project developed during the Digital Fabrication Studio course, 0.2 edition

## PROPOSAL 01
A customized fitting pair of high-heeled 3d printed sandals.  I will take a 3d scan of my foot and build the footbed of the shoe based on that, and will design the heels etc to withstand my weight.  I plan to use ABS plastic because it is harder.
