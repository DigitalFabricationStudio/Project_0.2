# Cartoon Wall Clock

Personal project developed during the Digital Fabrication Studio course, 0.2 edition

## PROPOSAL 01
Cartoony wall clock
I want to make a really large clock for my wall.

I will get a clock mechanism from a craft shop, 
and add custom made hands and numbers for the clock, hands cut by lasercutter in plastic and numbers printed on the vinyl cutter.  
The hands need to be weighted, so I will need to calculate the same surface area for both the pointer and the knob.







## PROPOSAL 02
A customized fitting pair of high-heeled 3d printed sandals.  I will take a 3d scan of my foot and build the footbed of the shoe based on that, and will design the heels etc to withstand my weight.  I plan to use ABS plastic because it is harder.
Actually, I might have issues making the piece that holds the toes on, unless the support pillars are enough to hold it there, I'm thinking about how to solve that.  Maybe I save this project for when I have more time because such a big object would also take more than a few hours to print so class time maybe is not enough.
