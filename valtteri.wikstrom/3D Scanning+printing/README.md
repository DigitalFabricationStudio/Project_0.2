## Exercise: 3D scan and print your head

### Valtteri Wikstr√∂m

This exercise was a bit tedious, because taking photos to make a 3D scan is not an ideal way. Anyway, Dipti helped me to take a bunch of pictures, and with the help of 123DCatch and Blender (and Massimo) I managed to get an ok scan of my face. The backside of my head was completely lost though. Once the scan was created, 3D printing was straight-forward with the 3D touch -printer.

### Note:
Don't try to remesh your model on a too high level and then proceed to sculpt it a lot. I ended up with a 40MB model at some point...
