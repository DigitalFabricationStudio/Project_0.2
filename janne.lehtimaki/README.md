# TITLE OF THE PROJECT

Personal project developed during the Digital Fabrication Studio course, 0.2 edition

__FOLLOWING IS A PRELIMINARY PLAN. IMAGES AND IN-DEPTH DESCRIPTIONS WILL BE ADDED DURING THE WEEK__

## PROPOSAL 01: Experimental Visual Box

The project is a combination of various visual ideas and techniques I have been learning and developing further in my mind.

The box is a platform for visual experimentation. The plan is to make a cube has all the surfaces facing inside made out of mirror. One of the walls has a small hole for video camera objective so that the inside of the box can be filmed. Alternatively one wall could be made of two-way mirror.

All the surfaces will be easily detachable. This will allow for removing any wall/ceiling/floor while keeping other parts in place. The frame will hold the remaining parts in place while some of them are removed.

When the ceiling or the sides are removed, lights or video projections can be projected to the mirrors inside resulting in kaleidoscope and infinity mirror -like effects the camera can capture. 
The possibilities for experimentation are almost endless. Playing with camera angles and zoom, using different lighting techniques such as LED painting and oil projections, or even projecting some material made in Processing using a video projector. 

Or if the floor is removed, objects can be placed on a revolving platform (for example made out of a turntable) which will then rotate inside the box. The objects could be prisms or crystals or some material that will reflect light. Or some 3D printed objects.

Also, one or more of the mirrors could be replaced by a green screen of the same size and then the video signal could be fed live to VJ software and chroma keyed so that it could be combined with other material.

The frame will be made by laser cutting suitable pieces from (6mm?)MDF board and then joining them to form the frame. The mirrors will be acrylic mirror.

( The frame could already be made during the following session:

9th Oct 2012 9:00 - 12:00: Morning:  Laser cutting: technology, processes and design techniques.
Homework:  Design and fabricate a laser cut box or interlocking object.

## PROPOSAL 02: Continuing Proposal 01

If the time allows, the project can be continued further.

I have an idea of making geometric surfaces by using origami -like paper folding techniques. The paper surfaces could then be 3D scanned using Autodesk 123D and modified in Blender to fit the box floor nicely. 

When happy with the design, the object will be 3D printed. After that the printed object will be sanded to very smooth surface and painted with chrome paint to make it as reflective as possible. It would serve as a nice reflective LED painting canvas that would interact with the mirrors nicely.

80s video game vector graphic aesthetics are inspiration for the surface.
